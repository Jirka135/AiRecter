# Project Roadmap: Browser-based AI-Generated Image Recognition

## 5. Core Development Phases
### Phase 1: Basic Frontend and UI
- **Initial Layout**: Create the basic layout using HTML and CSS.
- **User Interface**: Design and implement the UI with React.js or Vue.js.
- **Routing**: Set up client-side routing.

### Phase 2: Image Processing and ML Model Integration
- **Data Collection**: Collect a dataset of images for training and testing.
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model to recognize AI-generated images using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Model Conversion**: Convert the trained model to a format suitable for the browser (e.g., TensorFlow.js).
- **Model Integration**: Integrate the ML model into the frontend application.

### Phase 3: Backend Development (Optional)
- **API Development**: Develop a RESTful API for handling image uploads and processing (if needed).
- **Database Integration**: Implement database functionalities to store user data and image analysis results.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- **Real-time Image Recognition**: Implement real-time image recognition using webcam input.
- **User Authentication**: Add user authentication and authorization features.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize performance focusing on image processing speed and model inference time.

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for frontend and backend components.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure all parts of the application work together seamlessly.
- **User Testing**: Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback and identify usability issues.

## 7. Deployment and Maintenance
- **Deployment**: Deploy the application to a web server or cloud platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Heroku).
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring tools to track performance and usage.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Maintenance**: Regularly update the application, fix bugs, and add new features based on user feedback.

## 8. Documentation and Support
- **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for code, APIs, and user guides.
- **Support and Community**: Set up support channels (e.g., forums, chat groups) to engage with users and gather feedback.
